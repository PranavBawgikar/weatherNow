This is a Weather App which allows users to fetch weather information using a RESTful API from weatherstack.com.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, you will need to register on weatherstack.com to obtain an API key. The API key will be used to make requests and retrieve weather data.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to install the axios library:

```bash
npm install axios --save
```

4. To use React Poppers with PopperJS wrapper, install the necessary packages:

```bash
npm i react-popper @popper/js
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits, and you will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about running tests in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed! See the section about deployment in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
